## 🏃 How It Works

These calculators use two proven methods:

1. **VDOT Method (Jack Daniels):** Uses equivalent performance tables based on aerobic fitness level - the gold standard trusted by coaches and Olympians worldwide.

2. **Riegel Formula:** T₂ = T₁ × (D₂/D₁)^1.06 - Accounts for the aerobic and anaerobic demands of different distances.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Predictions assume proper training for the target distance
- Marathon predictions require specific long-distance training and fueling strategy
- Weather, terrain, and race conditions significantly impact actual performance
- Use these as training goals, not guarantees

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No dependencies or frameworks
- Mobile responsive
- Works offline once loaded
